# Suduko
This repository contains the code for creating and solving sudoku board.
The Suduko Program contains one file:
         ->  start.py
         
 To run the program follow the steps:
     
     -> Download the zip file.
     
     -> Extract all files in the same folder.
     
     -> Run start.py file using a terminal or ide (whichever method is preferred by you).
     
     
  WORKING:
  
  	-> The Program will ask user to input number of values to be filled at the beginning.
  
  	-> The Program will first generate a complete valid Sudoku board and then remove 
  	some numbers from random grid and then display it.
  	
  	-> The Program will also display the complete generated board for verification.
  	
     
     Note:- Currently the program may take input from terminal only (No GUI is available).
